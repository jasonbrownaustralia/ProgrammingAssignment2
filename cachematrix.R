## This assignment (number 2) is to write a pair of functions that cache the
## inverse of a matrix to improve program performance. We assume the matrix is
## always invertible.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really
## a list containing a function to
## - set the value of the matrix
## - get the value of the matrix
## - set/calculate the inverse of the matrix
## - get the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
  
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created
## with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has
## already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips
## the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets
## the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(inv)
  inv
  
}
